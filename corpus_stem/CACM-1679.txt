a fast fourier transform algorithm for real valu seri a new procedur is present for calcul the complex discret fourier transform of real valu time seri thi procedur is describ for an exampl where the number of point in the seri is an integr power of two thi algorithm preserv the order and symmetri of the coolei turkei fast fourier transform algorithm while effect the two to on reduct in comput and storag which can be achiev when the seri is real also discuss ar hardwar and softwar implement of the algorithm which perform onli n log n complex multipli and add oper and which requir onli n real storag locat in analyz each n point record cacm octob bergland g d fast fourier transform time seri analysi digit filter spectral analysi real time spectrum analyz fourier analysi discret fourier transform digit spectrum analysi fourier analysi algorithm fourier synthesi algorithm ca jb februari pm
