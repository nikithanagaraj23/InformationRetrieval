comput gener of gamma random variat with non integr shape paramet when the shape paramet a is integr gener gamma random variabl with a digit comput is straightforward there is no simpl method for gener gamma random variat with non integr shape paramet a common procedur is to approxim gener such random variabl by us of the so call probabl switch method anoth procedur which is exact is due to johnk thi paper present a reject method for exactli gener gamma random variabl when a is greater than the effici of the reject method is shown to be better than the effici of johnk s method the paper conclud that when a is non integr the follow mix of procedur yield the best combin of accuraci and effici when a is less than us johnk s method when is less than a and a is less than us the reject method when a is greater than us the probabl switch method cacm decemb wallac n d simul gamma random variabl probabl distribut random number ca jb januari am
