optim shift strategi for a block transfer ccd memori for the purpos of thi paper a block transfer ccd memori is compos of serial shift regist whose shift rate can vari but which have a definit minimum shift rate the refresh rate and a definit maximum shift rate the bit iin the shift regist ar number to n and block of n bit ar alwai transfer alwai start at bit what is the best shift strategi so that a block transfer request occur at a random time will have to wait the minim amount of time befor bit can be reach the minimum shift rate requir doe not allow on to simpli park at bit and wait for a transfer request the optim strategi involv shift as slowli as possibl until bit is pass then shift as quickli as possibl until a critic boundari is reach shortli befor bit come around again thi is call the hurri up and wait strategi and is well known outsid the comput field the block transfer ccd memori can also be view as a page drum with a variabl bound rotat speed cacm mai site r page drum charg coupl devic shift regist memori memori hierarchi electron drum latenc ca dh februari pm
