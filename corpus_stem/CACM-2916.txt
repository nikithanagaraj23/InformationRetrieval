a fast string search algorithm an algorithm is present that search for the locat i of the first occurr of a charact string pat in anoth string string dure the search oper the charact of pat ar match start with the last charact of pat the inform gain by start the match at the end of the pattern often allow the algorithm to proce in larg jump through the text be search thu the algorithm ha the unusu properti that in most case not all of the first i charact of string ar inspect the number of charact actual inspect on the averag decreas as a function of the length of pat for a random english pattern of length the algorithm will typic inspect i charact of string befor find a match at i furthermor the algorithm ha been implement so that on the averag fewer than i patlen machin instruct ar execut these conclus ar support with empir evid and a theoret analysi of the averag behavior of the algorithm the worst case behavior of the algorithm is linear in i patlen assum the avail of arrai space for tabl linear in patlen plu the size of the alphabet cacm octob boyer r s bibliograph search comput complex inform retriev linear time bound pattern match text edit ca jb decemb am
