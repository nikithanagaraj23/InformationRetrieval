perturb of eigenvalu of non normal matric the problem consid is to give bound for finit perturb of simpl and multipl eigenvalu of nonnorm matric where these bound ar in term of the eigenvalu the departur from normal and the frobeniu norm of the perturb matrix but not in term of the eigen system the bound which ar deriv ar shown to be almost attain for ani set of matric cacm januari van der slui a perturb of eigenvalu non normal matric departur from normal gershgorin circl ca jb januari am
