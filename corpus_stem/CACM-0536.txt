nonlinear regress and the solut of simultan equat if on ha a set of observ z zm which ar bound in a relat with certain paramet a an by an equat s z a on frequent ha the problem of determin a set of valu of the ai which minim the sum of squar of differ between observ and calcul valu of a distinguish observ sai zm if the solut of the abov equat for zm zm n z a give rise to a function n which is nonlinear in the ai then on mai reli on a version of gaussian regress for an iter scheme that converg to a minim set of valu it is shown here that thi same minim techniqu mai be us for the solut of simultan not necessarili linear equat cacm juli baer r m ca jb march pm
