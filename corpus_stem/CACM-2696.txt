a method of bivari interpol and smooth surfac fit base on local procedur a method is design for interpol valu given at point of a rectangular grid in a plane by a smooth bivari function z z x y the interpol function is a bicub polynomi in each cell of the rectangular grid emphasi is an avoid excess undul between given grid point the propos method is an extens of the method of univari interpol develop earlier by the author and is likewis base on local procedur cacm januari akima h bivari interpol interpol partial deriv polynomi smooth surfac fit ca jb januari pm
