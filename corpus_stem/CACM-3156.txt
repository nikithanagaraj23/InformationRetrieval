comput connect compon on parallel comput we present a parallel algorithm which us n processor to find the connect compon of an undirect graph with n vertic in time o logn an o logn time bound also can be achiev us onli n n logn processor the algorithm can be us to find the transit closur of a symmetr boolean matrix we assum that the processor have access to a common memori simultan access to the same locat is permit for fetch instruct but not for store instruct cacm august hirschberg d chandra a sarwat d graph theori parallel process algorithm transit closur connect compon ca db januari pm
