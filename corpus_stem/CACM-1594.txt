an algorithm for gener permut an algorithm is describ which under repeat applic gener all permut of k element onli the previous gener permut the constant k and a temporari index ar need start with a particular order of k element abcd repeat applic of the algorithm will gener k addit permut by k success rotat from the initi circular order of k object anoth circular order can be obtain by rotat the k lowest element for each new k circular order anoth k can be obtain by rotat the k lowest element by continu in thi manner applic of the algorithm will gener all k circular order or sinc each circular order yield k permut the algorithm gener all k permut cacm mai langdon jr g g ca jb februari am
