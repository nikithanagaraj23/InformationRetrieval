the reconstruct of binari pattern from their project given the horizont and vertic project of a finit binari pattern f can we construct the origin pattern f in thi paper we give a character of pattern that ar reconstruct from their project three algorithm ar develop to reconstruct both unambigu and ambigu pattern it is shown that an unambigu pattern can be perfectli reconstruct in time m x n and that a pattern similar to an ambigu pattern can also be construct in time m x n where m n ar the dimens of the pattern frame cacm januari chang s pattern reconstruct imag reconstruct data compress pattern recognit integr geometri ca jb februari pm
