some performance tests of quicksort and descendants detailed performance evaluations are presented for six acm algorithms quicksort no shellsort no stringsort no treesort no quickersort no and qsort no algorithms and are refinements of algorithm , and all three are discussed in some detail the evidence given here demonstrates that qsort no requires many more comparisons than its author claims of all these algorithms quickersort requires the fewest comparisons to sort random arrays cacm march loeser r sorting in-place sorting sorting efficiency sorting performance tests quicksort quickersort qsort shellsort stringsort treesort,utility sort algorithm general-purpose sort algorithm sorting algorithm documentation . . ca jb january , am
