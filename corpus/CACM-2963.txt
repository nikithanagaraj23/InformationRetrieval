a fast algorithm for computing longest common subsequences previously published algorithms for finding the longest common subsequence of two sequences of length n have had a best-case running time of on an algorithm for this problem is presented which has a running time of or nlog n where r is the total number of ordered pairs of positions at which the two sequences match thus in the worst case the algorithm has a running time of on log n however for those applications where most positions of one sequence match relatively few positions in the other sequence a running time of on log n can be expected cacm may hunt j w szymanski t g longest common subsequence efficient algorithms . . . ca jb december , am
