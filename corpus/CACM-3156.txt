computing connected components on parallel computers we present a parallel algorithm which uses n processors to find the connected components of an undirected graph with n vertices in time ologn an ologn time bound also can be achieved using only nnlogn processors the algorithm can be used to find the transitive closure of a symmetric boolean matrix we assume that the processors have access to a common memory simultaneous access to the same location is permitted for fetch instructions but not for store instructions cacm august hirschberg d chandra a sarwate d graph theory parallel processing algorithms transitive closure connected component . . . ca db january , pm
