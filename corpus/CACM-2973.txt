sorting on a mesh-connected parallel computer two algorithms are presented for sorting n elements on an n x n mesh-connected processor array that require on routing and comparison steps the best previous algorithm takes time on log n the algorithms of this paper are shown to be optimal in time within small constant factors extensions to higher-dimensional arrays are also given cacm april thompson c d kung h t parallel computer parallel sorting parallel merge routing and comparison steps perfect shuffle processor in terconnection pattern . . . ca jb december , am
