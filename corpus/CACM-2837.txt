new upper bounds for selection the worst-case minimum number of comparisons complexity vin of the i-th selection problem is considered a new upper bound for vin improves the bound given by the standard hadian-sobel algorithm by a generalization of the kirkpatrick-hadian-sobel algorithm and extends kirkpatricks method to a much wider range of application this generalization compares favorably with a recent algorithm by hyafil cacm september yap c k selection problem algorithms comparison problems concrete computational complexity upper bounds worst-case analysis . . ca jb january , am
