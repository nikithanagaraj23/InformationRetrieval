merging with parallel processors consider two linearly ordered sets a b am bn mn and p pm parallel processors working synchronously the paper presents an algorithm for merging a and b with the p parallel processors which requires at most log mmp mplog nm steps if n bm b an integer the algorithm requires at most log m mpb steps in the case where m and n are of the same order of magnitude ie nkm with k being a constant the algorithm requires log m mpk steps these performances compare very favorably with the previous best parallel merging algorithm batchers algorithm which requires np mnplog m steps in the general case and kmp kmplog m in the special case where nkm cacm october gavril f parallel processing parallel merging parallel binary insertion . ca jb january , am
