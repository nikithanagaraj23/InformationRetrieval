cubic spline solutions to fourth-order boundary value problems the cubic spline approximation to the fourth-order differential equation ypxyqxyrxytx is shown to reduce to the solution of a five-term recurrence relationship for some special cases the approximation is shown to be simply related to a finite difference representation with a local truncation error of order ydelta. cacm june hoskins w d cubic spline differential equations boundary value problem . . ca jb january , pm
