connections between accuracy and stability properties of linear multistep formulas this paper is concerned with stability and accuracy of families of linear k-step formulas depending on parameters with particular emphasis on the numerical solution of stiff ordinary differential equations an upper bound pk is derived for the order of accuracy of ainf-stable formulas three criteria are given for a-stability it is shown that for pk k arbitrary ainf-stability implies certain necessary conditions for a-stability and for strict stability meaning that the extraneous roots of ppsi satisfy psi for pk,,,and , ainf-stability for k together with another constraint implies strict stability and for certain one-parameter classes of formulas with pk,,andor , ainf-stability implies a-stability cacm january liniger w stiff equations parametrized linear multistep formulas order of accuracy a-stability ainf-stability strict stability . ca jb january , am
