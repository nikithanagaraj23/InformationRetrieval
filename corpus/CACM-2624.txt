formal requirements for virtualizable third generation architectures virtual machine systems have been implemented on a limited number of third generation computer systems eg cp- on the ibm . from previous empirical studies it is known that certain third generation computer systems eg the dec pdp-, cannot support a virtual machine system in this paper model of a third-generation-like computer system is developed formal techniques are used to derive precise sufficient conditions to test whether such an architecture can support virtual machines cacm july popek g j goldberg r p operating system third generation architecture sensitive instruction formal requirements abstract model proof virtual machine virtual memory hypervisor virtual machine monitor . . . . ca jb january , am
